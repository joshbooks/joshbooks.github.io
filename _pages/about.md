title: A Short(ish) History of My Career

I am a programmer.
That's not all I am but it's definitely the headline. 
I started doing system administration in high school, then floundered around
for a while wondering what I could do for a job that involved computers.
Then-- like the smart-ass kid I was, I got a System Administrator job at my 
junior college by telling the head of IT the admin password for all the school 
computers. 

After a while it seemed like the most fun part of doing System
Administration was writing scripts (still one of my great passions) because 
every time I wrote a script it meant that there was another boring thing I
didn't have to do anymore. It turned out that there was a job that was just 
doing that all day and it paid better. Some people call that job 
Software Engineering, some people call it hacking (although I guess that's 
a bad word now that sketchy people who do bad things use it to describe 
themselves), a friend of mine calls it "artisan keyboard mashing." Call 
it what you will, it's automating things that are super boring and/or 
stressful to do by hand. 

With that figured out I went to a real college to get a fancy degree so 
I could get fancy jobs. While I was there I actually learned some stuff too. 
Like how Operating Systems work, they're basically accountants cum kindergarten 
teachers. They just maintain a bunch of tables and lists to keep track of what
programs are using what physical resources (memory, CPU time, etc) so that it 
can keep programs from running into each other or doing mean things on the sly. 
I learned about algorithms too, it turns out that over the years a lot of really 
smart people have figured out good general ways to do some surprisingly hard things 
very efficiently and often very beautifully (don't believe me? look up a 
visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm sometime). 

After my first semester at college I figured I was basically amazing at 
everything so I got a job at IBM that wound up lasting until 3 months after
I graduated. My first boss was the best boss I have ever had, he looked at an
angry kid with a lot of issues and saw someone who would work hard and do good 
things if dealt with gently. While I was working for him I automated a release
process (by writing a transpiler in bash), a source code license updating problem
(by writing an Ant script that wrote an Ant script and then executed it), and a
number of other smaller tasks. Then IBM started going through a reorg (reorginization
to those lucky enough to be unfamiliar, it's where a company fires people, then decides
who should manage who now that there are less people and if you're now a manager your
first job is to fire some more people, three years later this particular reorg is still 
ongoing) and I stopped feeling like I was getting away with 
murder. I was doing less work (indeed for a few months I was doing literally 
no work) but it felt like the money (it was significantly more money than when
I started) was less worth what I had to do to get it (show up to work at 9ish
every day and sit on my hands for 8 hours). 

Around this time I was living in a hacker house in San Jose (with 8 other people),
drinking a lot and watching a lot of Silicon Valley. It seemed like
start-ups were the hot thing to do, and if you had good ideas and were willing
to work hard you could do great things. So I joined a start up that you'll
never hear about unless its bankruptcy case sets some kind of record.
I was almost immediately put in charge of the indexer, a word that still makes
my heart pound just a little harder. It was a program that was designed to
look inside files as they were added and modified to see what was inside them.
At first the company was into encryption, so the indexer's job was to determine
how those files should be encrypted based on the content of those files, which
I thought then and think now is the future of security. Then that wasn't making
money so the CEO decided that we should just sell the indexer. Sell companies
on the idea that they should spend money looking into what their employees were 
doing. Sell a sophisticated nanny-cam. I did it, and I did some of the best technical 
work of my life, but a lot of engineers that I admire left when the CEO made that 
decision and I often wonder if I should have left too. 

When it became clear that the company was not long for this world I left for greener
pastures. I could spend-- and have spent, entire days dissecting just exactly why the 
company failed. Was it all my fault? There were 20-30 other people at the company and
I had gotten out of college 3 months before I started, so it probably wasn't all my 
fault. I was there and I was a significant part of the company so I'm definitely inculpated.
Ultimately that question is moot. It did fail, so now I have to learn all I can from the
experience and move on. Now I work at Rubrik Inc, where we sell backup and recovery. It's
not glamorous work, but it's a moral neutral-leaning-positive and there are plenty of boring
and stressful things that need automating.
