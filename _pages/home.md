I spend most of my time writing code to last. I like to think I've gotten 
pretty good at it.

Need a pretty website like this one? No problem.

Need an e-commerce website? 

That isn't going to cost you an insane amount of money?

Or leave you open to hackers? 

I'm all about it.

Need a file system filter driver? I'm your guy.

Need some obsolete database reverse engineered and connected to Apache Kafka?
Also your guy. 

Using Tika and/or Lucene? 

And need to cut down on memory usage?

While increasing speed? 

I'm all over it.
