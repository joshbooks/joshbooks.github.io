title: What's Stressing You Out?

I get stressed when I have a bunch of things I have to do and it seems like I'm going
to have to do them forever. When I start to feel that way I try to think of ways I
could not do them ever again. Usually this involves writing code, when it doesn't
it almost always involves rubber bands.

I wouldn't recommend you hire me to make a website. I can and will, but my rate is much
higher than a lot of guys who would do an equally good job. I specialize in things that
are weird and just a little bit gross. Need a file system filter driver? I'm your guy.
Need some obsolete technology reverse engineered and/or connected to newer technology?
Also your guy.

If you have a problem that sounds something like that-- or you think you might but aren't 
sure, hit the Contact button up top (or inside the menu if you're on a phone) and shoot me
an email.
