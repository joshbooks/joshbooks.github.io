title: What's Broken?

I spend most of my time fixing code that doesn't work right. Sometimes I make things
and try very hard to make them work right. I like to think I've gotten pretty good at it.

I wouldn't recommend you hire me to make a pretty website. There are a lot of people who
would do a better job at that than I would. Need a file system filter driver? I'm your guy.
Need some obsolete technology reverse engineered and/or connected to newer technology?
Also your guy. Using Tika and/or Lucene and need to cut down on memory usage while
increasing speed? I'm all over it.

If you have a problem that sounds something like that then hit the Contact button up
top and shoot me an email.
