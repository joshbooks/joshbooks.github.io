I spend most of my time building stuff. I like to think I've gotten 
pretty good at it.

Need a pretty website like this one? No problem.

Need a file system filter driver? I'm your guy.

Need some obsolete database reverse engineered and replicated offsite?  
To the cloud?  
Also your guy. 

Using Tika and/or Lucene?  
And need to cut down on memory usage?  
While increasing speed?  
I'm all over it.

Need an e-commerce website?  
That isn't going to cost you an insane amount of money?  
Or leave you open to hackers?  
I got you.
