If you have some work for me or you just think I'm a cool guy and want to get a beer shoot me an 
[email](mailto:me@joshbooks.com). It's my preferred mode of communication. If it's super crazy
urgent I would advise you to put "work" in the subject line and a clear description of the problem
in the body. If you want to look at some of my open source work (it's like a portfolio for programmers)
you can find me on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/joshbooks)
